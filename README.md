This is a simple script to track updates in a webpage. The main use-case is when we are waiting for any notification or result to be announced on the webpage, we would have to continuously refresh the page to keep checking. This script automates the job for us. The idea is that after every time period, it will calculate the hash value of the webpage and compare it to the previous hash value. If there is a change, it will notify the user by mailing it to them.
